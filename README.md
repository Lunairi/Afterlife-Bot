# Afterlife-Bot
Discord bot for Afterlife

Code is messy and needs cleaning/some refactoring and minor optimization, scripted between work breaks so it's not as clean as it could be

This was originally uploaded on my secondary account on github, later moved to my main one. The goal of this bot was to make it easier for users to find party and play together on a mobile game called Alchemia Story. The bot is written in node.js using the node discord.js api. Bot's no longer maintained or updated.
